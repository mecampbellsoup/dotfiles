## dotfiles

Most of the popular dotfiles repos (e.g. [@holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles))
seem like over-engineering from my point of view.

I just want any changes I make to config files to be available to me over
time as I change computers, workstations, jobs, projects, etc.

## TODO

* Write (or steal!) a script which automatically symlinks all the files in this
repository where they need to be placed for the system, i.e. `~`.
